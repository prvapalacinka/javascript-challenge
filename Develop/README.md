# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

The webpage contains a password generator that was assigned its functionality through javascript. 

Functionality:
The password generator (upon click of the generate password button) will ask the user what length they would like for their generated password to be. Then, the password generator will prompt the user to select whether or not they would like to include (ok) or not like to include (cancel) the following variables within their password: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. 

Upon completion of the prompts, the password will be generated. 

If the user fails to select a character count between 8-128 then the user will be presented with an alert stating that they must select a number between 8-128 for the password character length.
